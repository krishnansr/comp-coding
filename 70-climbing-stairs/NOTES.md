For dynamic way to solve it for any N steps instead of just [1, 2] - using DP is the only optimal way, sample solution - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrFg9SZ8VoM 

(fibonacci like solution needs more variables for N steps which eventually becomes like a DP)
(caching approach is slow + not scalable)
